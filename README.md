# 🧬 Quantum-Secured-Inter-Hospital-Document-Transfer-System


This project implements a secure document transmission system between hospitals using **simulated Quantum Key Distribution (BB84 protocol)** and **quantum cryptography principles**. Built using **Python Flask** and **QuTiP**, it demonstrates how sensitive medical files (PDFs) can be securely shared using quantum-safe methods.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔒 Simulated **Quantum Key Exchange** using BB84
- 🏥 Hospital-specific logins: Hospital 1 (sender), Hospital 2 (receiver)
- 📄 Secure PDF text extraction, encryption, and transmission
- 📈 QBER calculation to detect eavesdropping or transmission errors
- 💻 Web-based interface built with HTML, CSS, JS
- 🎇 Particle background animations for engaging UI
